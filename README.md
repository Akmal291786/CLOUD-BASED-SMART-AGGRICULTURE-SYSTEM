# CLOUD-BASED-SMART-AGGRICULTURE-SYSTEM
This project proposes the development of a Cloud-Based Smart Agriculture System designed to revolutionize 
conventional farming methods. By integrating IoT-based environmental sensors, cloud computing, and data 
analytics, the system continuously monitors critical environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, 
and soil moisture in real time
